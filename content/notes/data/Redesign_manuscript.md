### Abstract
Despite decades of deconstructive critique, institutional and disciplinary frameworks remain structurally Kantian—testifying not to any failure of critique, but to the enduring design potential of Kant’s architectonics. This paper proposes that Kant’s philosophical corpus, including his three Critiques and his 1786 essay on orientation, can be reinterpreted as a four-layered design template—Idea, Orientation, Condition, Structure—capable of renewing institutional world-making under contemporary conditions of epistemic automation and democratic fatigue. While much recent work has emphasized either the epistemological or normative dimensions of Kant, I suggest that his architectonic logic provides a generative schema that not only grounds critique, but also supports responsive institutional formation. Central to this account is the philosophical concept of orientation: a pre-institutional, directional modality through which Ideas become formable and revisable within contingent structures. Engaging with Nancy, Rancière, Biesta, and Derrida, the paper develops a meta-institutional framework that complements critique with a constructive focus on design. The concept of the *institutionless institution* —a regime where normative frameworks persist without visibility or accountability—is diagnosed as the erosion of this orientational layer. In response, I recast orientation as a philosophical praxis linking Ideas to responsive and revisable institutional forms. Ultimately, the paper aims to contribute to contemporary continental philosophy by supplementing critique with new resources for imaginative reconfiguration, positioning Kant as a resource not of closure, but of ongoing institutional renewal.

### 1:	Introduction: The Disappearance of Designability — Toward a Philosophy of Institutional Orientation
How can institutions be redesigned—not merely altered functionally, but re-imagined philosophically? This question is not merely a matter of applied design theory; it constitutes a fundamental critique of the form of reason itself and offers a generative point of departure amid the intellectual and institutional impasses we face today. This paper attempts to reactivate the imaginative capacity of reason in times of institutional fatigue and the erosion of Ideas by extracting and reconstructing an *institutional design template* that lies latent within Kantian philosophy.[^1] Kant’s system of reason was not only a philosophical theory, but also a structural schema that endowed the three domains of cognition, ethics, and aesthetics with institutional durability and legitimacy. Through a systematic account of transcendental conditions, Kant addressed the problem of how freedom could be institutionalized—and in so doing, reason came to include within itself a capacity for designing the very conditions under which questioning itself becomes possible.

This rational capacity for institutional design provided the Enlightenment with foundational structures for the institutions of science, morality, and aesthetics. Yet today, that very robustness has paradoxically led to institutional rigidity and a loss of responsiveness. While attempts have been made to critically dismantle the Kantian configuration—Heidegger reading institutions as sites of the fallenness of Being, Derrida destabilizing the formalism of institutional language, and Foucault historicizing the distribution of knowledge and power within institutions[^2] —twentieth-century thought has largely approached institutions as sites where the very possibility of questioning has been suspended or foreclosed. In contrast, contemporary thinkers such as Jean-Luc Nancy, Jacques Rancière, and Gert Biesta have begun to re-engage with the responsiveness and co-presence that institutions make possible, particularly within the practices of education and democracy.[^3] These re-engagements underscore the necessity of structural mediation.

[^3]:See e.g., Nancy (2000), Rancière (1998), Biesta (2006) for recent accounts of institutional responsiveness and plurality.

However, a deeper and subtler crisis has emerged in recent decades—one that eludes even the most incisive traditions of institutional critique. Beyond overt mechanisms of violence or the suppression of questioning, we are now confronted with the paradoxical persistence of institutions whose very forms have become opaque and invisible. This condition, which I call the *institutionless institution* —a term that denotes institutional forms which, while continuing to function, have become so opaque and inaccessible as to be, for all practical purposes, invisible to critique andredesign—marks a situation in which the normative and structural frameworks of collective life persist, but do so in ways that resist both recognition and conscious transformation. The result is that not only are critical questions stifled, but ...the very possibility of institutional redesign—what I call designability, meaning the capacity for institutions to remain open to intentional critique and renewal—has itself become endangered. This paper’s intervention, though structurally inspired by Kant, does not seek to revive his architectonics in its original form. Rather, it reclaims the spirit of Enlightenment that animated Kant’s project—a commitment to autonomy, critique, and the ongoing design of conditions under which thought and freedom may emerge. The horizon of transformation recedes as institutional structures withdraw from view, rendering critique paralyzed and the future of collective life increasingly unintelligible.

This crisis is not simply the product of neoliberal governance or the logic of late modernity, but signals a more profound philosophical loss: the erasure of what might be termed the *orientation layer* —the domain in which institutions become visible, designable, and open to responsive transformation. This concern with orientation has deep roots in Kant’s philosophy—not only in the three Critiques, but especially in his 1786 essay, “What Does It Mean to Orient Oneself in Thinking?” There, Kant frames orientation as a condition for autonomous thought, one that enables movement in the absence of external guidance. This notion of orientation is not merely metaphorical; it names the inner capacity of reason to design its own direction. It is this dimension that this paper seeks to recover and reframe at the institutional level. Without such a layer, the dynamics of institutional life are rendered inaccessible; change becomes unthinkable, and the status quo is preserved by its very invisibility. Previous critiques have revealed the violence and rigidity of institutional forms, but have not addressed the deeper problem: the erosion of the very conditions that make institutional design—and thus institutional renewal—possible.[^4] This paper intervenes precisely at this juncture, proposing a new philosophical account of orientation as the condition of institutional designability. Thus, the central question for contemporary philosophy is not only how to critique or justify institutions, but how to recover and theorize the very conditions under which institutional design and redesign remain possible.
[^4]:See e.g., Foucault (1977), Derrida (1992), Brown (2015) for analyses of institutional power, opacity, and the crisis of democratic agency.

Nevertheless, the question of how the relation between Ideas and institutions might be re-mediated through a design-based format—that is, what orientation and formal structures are required to ensure the continual renewability of institutions—has remained under-theorized. The very need for such a mediating framework has remained, until now, a largely unarticulated problem. Yet it is precisely in this unmarked space that a new mode of reconstructive critique—one that not only critiques existing forms, but also envisions their renewal—becomes possible. Accordingly, the aims of this paper are twofold:

- To return to Kant’s project and examine how he was able to generate such structurally robust foundations for modern institutions, and to extract and analyze the institutional design template that is implicitly operative within his thought.

- To apply this extracted template—integrating insights from all three Critiques—to contemporary institutional contexts, with a diagnostic emphasis on the academic institution as shaped by Kantian epistemology, and to explore pathways for redesign inspired by Nancy, Rancière, and Biesta.

While the paper begins by introducing the template latent in Kantian philosophy, this template is not to be understood as a mere formal apparatus. Rather, it is essentially tied to the philosophical problem of orientation. The template is born of orientation and ultimately returns to it; it is a circular movement that both emerges from and shapes the stance from which institutional design is possible.

### 2: The Template as the Generative Force of Institutional Subjectivity
#### 2.1: Why Extract an Institutional Template from Kant? Architectonic Ambition and the Problem of Orientation
The extraction of an institutional design template from Kant’s philosophy is not a projection of contemporary concerns onto his work, but a response to Kant’s own architectonic ambitions. Kant’s critical system—especially as articulated in the *Critique of Pure Reason*[^5] —was conceived not merely as a set of doctrines, but as a systematic architecture enabling the self-legitimation and perpetual critique of reason’s own institutions. Across his three Critiques, Kant systematizes reason into distinct domains—cognition, moral action, and aesthetic judgment—each endowed with a principled form capable of institutional embodiment and ongoing renewal. As he states, “Reason must subject itself to critique in all its undertakings,”[^6] a maxim that grounds the continual design and redesign of the conditions for cognition, morality, and taste. Kant further foregrounds the indispensability of orientation for rational action and judgment; as he puts it, “To orient oneself means, properly, to use a subjective basis for making judgments when objective principles of reason are insufficient.”[^7] Thus, the architecture of the Critiques, together with meta-critical reflections on orientation, directly warrant the extraction of a systematic template for the formation and renewal of institutions.

[^7]:WA, p. 238.


Such a design-oriented reading of Kant finds further substantiation in recent Kantian scholarship. Thinkers such as Henry Allison and P. F. Strawson have emphasized that Kant’s philosophy should be understood not as a mere empirical description but as a transcendental constitution—that is, a framework that actively constructs the very conditions for cognition and morality. From this perspective, the three Critiques can be interpreted institutionally as articulating distinct modes of attunement through which we relate to the world.[^8]
[^8]:See Allison (2004, Ch. 1–2, esp. pp. 3–59) for a systematic account of Kant’s notion of transcendental constitution. See also Strawson (1966, Introduction and Part One, pp. 15–108), which, despite its departure from Kant’s transcendental idealism, underscores the systematic role of the Critique of Pure Reason in delineating the structural preconditions for human cognition.

Pursuing this line of interpretation further, one finds that the moral-philosophical developments by Christine Korsgaard—especially her model of the legislative subject—and by Onora O’Neill—through her framework of public reason—reveal that Kantian principles such as universalizability and respect for persons function not only as moral imperatives but as structural templates. These principles are instantiated as institutional dispositions rooted in Ideas and enable such dispositions to remain publicly justifiable while undergoing self-renewal. In this sense, they serve as formative frameworks for institutional legitimacy.[^9] Jürgen Habermas, too, offers compelling evidence for this template-oriented reading, reconstructing Kant’s three Critiques as articulating cognitive, normative, and expressive aspects of reason—each fulfilling distinct functions while collectively ensuring the designability, legitimacy, and criticizability of institutions.[^10] Michel Foucault also reinterprets Kant, highlighting how modern thought constituted the human as an institutional object and thereby opened a space for analyzing the relationship between subjectivity and institutional form.[^11] Foucault’s reading does not support institutional design directly, but it problematizes the institutionalization of subjectivity in ways that render Kant’s critical project newly relevant. Taken together, these interpretive traditions strongly support the view that Kant’s philosophy already contains an implicit institutional design template—a framework not only of epistemic conditions but of institutional formation itself.
[^9]:O’Neill (1989, Ch. 3, pp. 73–94); Korsgaard (1996, Lecture 3, pp. 90–124).
[^10]:Habermas (1996, Introduction, Ch. 1, Ch. 8; 1987, pp. 106–130) develops a triadic conception of reason, distinguishing its cognitive, normative, and expressive dimensions. He links these dimensions to the communicative foundations of institutional legitimacy.
[^11]:See Foucault (1970), especially the concluding chapter, where Kant is positioned as the point of transition toward a modern episteme centered on the human as both subject and object of institutional discourse.


#### 2.2: Extracting the Institutional Template: From Critical Architecture to Design Schema
From this vantage, Kant’s three Critiques may be reinterpreted not as a purely theoretical system, but as a design-theoretical matrix composed of four interconnected layers essential to institutional formation: Idea, orientation, conditions, and structure. This paper refers to this process of directional formation as a template. A template is not a finalized blueprint but a design-space open to inquiry, in which orientations born from Ideas guide institutional selection, inform the operative conditions, and become realized through structural implementation. The generative flow from Idea to structure—mediated by orientation and condition—constitutes the core of this institutional genesis. By making this layered architecture explicit, the aim of this paper is to reposition the latent constructive power of Kantian philosophy as a reconfigurable institutional template capable of addressing contemporary challenges such as institutional fatigue and ideological hollowing.

The four-layered template extracted from Kant’s architectonic can be briefly clarified as follows.
Idea is used in the Kantian sense—as a regulative principle of reason that, while never fully realized in experience, orients and guides both inquiry and institutional formation from beyond their empirical limits, as written, “Reason’s Ideas […] serve as a guide (Leitfaden) where empirical rules are lacking.”[^12]
Orientation is understood as the act of rational self-positioning that provides direction in the absence of objective criteria, as written, “We require a guiding thread [Leitfaden] in order to orient ourselves when certainty is lacking.”[^13]
Condition is deployed here in a quasi-transcendental sense—not merely as a causal prerequisite, but as the generative horizon that enables institutional formation.[^14]
Structure refers to the institutional configuration that emerges from the dynamic interaction of Idea, orientation, and condition; it is not a static form, but a contingent articulation always open to critique and redesign.[^15]
[^12]:CPR, A665-6/B693-4.
[^13]:WA, pp. 238–239; The concept of orientation is introduced here as a mediating principle within the institutional template. Its deeper philosophical and practical implications will be discussed in detail in Chapter 3 below.

To approach institutional formation as a design process, we can reconfigure Kant’s three cognitive faculties—reason, understanding, and sensibility—in relation to a four-layered institutional architecture. Each faculty engages with the world through a distinct philosophical lens—epistemology, ethics, and aesthe tics—which, in turn, shape how Ideas, orientations, and conditions are formalized into institutional structures. Table 1 outlines this generative template, culminating in historically contingent institutional realizations.

Table 1.  
A Generative Template Linking Kantian Faculties to Institutional Formation[^16]
[^16]:Note: This table offers a speculative mapping between Kantian faculties and institutional layers. The categories are intended as heuristic, not doctrinal.

|   |Epistemology|Ethics|Aesthetics|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Idea**|Desire to unify the world cognitively|Belief in the necessity of human freedom (freedom as the highest good)|Aspiration for harmony between nature and freedom, experienced as beauty|
|**Orientation**|Reason imposes systematic unity (via understanding) upon sensibility to form an intelligible world|Reason legislates moral law (via understanding) to render the human as an autonomous agent|Sensibility reflects under reason’s guidance to detect signs of harmony in nature, independent of understanding[^17] |
|**Condition**|Time and space (from sensibility); categories (from understanding)|The moral law via the categorical imperative (from understanding)|Purposiveness without purpose; reflective judgment (from sensibility)|
|**Structure**|The world as a unified field of possible experience (phenomena vs. noumena)|The moral person as a dignified being|A shared sensibility of the sublime and beautiful as the trustworthiness of nature’s harmony|
|***Institutional Realization***|Institutions of knowledge (science)|Institutions of law and human rights|Institutions of culture (art)|
[^17]:This reading assigns reflective capacity to sensibility under reason’s guidance, which extends beyond the standard passive role ascribed to it in Kantian scholarship. A more detailed justification of this interpretive move will be developed in future work by the author.

Furthermore, to clarify how this design template operates across its generative stages, we can reinterpret Kant’s faculties through the lens of institutional functionality. While Table 1 emphasized the structural layers of institutional emergence across philosophical domains, Table 2 focuses on how each faculty contributes dynamically to the process of institutional design itself.

Table 2.  
Functional Roles of Kantian Faculties in Institutional Design[^18]
[^18]:Note: This table presents a conceptual reinterpretation of Kant’s cognitive faculties as functional mechanisms within institutional design processes. The metaphorical functions are heuristic and not intended as empirical descriptors.

|   |Functional Role in Institutional Design|Metaphorical Function|
|---|---|---|
|**Sensibility**|Receives input from the world; mediates responsiveness|Input sensor, reception port (intake of sensory signals)|
|**Understanding**|Provides structure through categories|Processing engine, structural encoder (analysis and synthesis)|
|**Reason**|Discerns Ideas; produces orientational stances|Frame-maker, directive system (design of questions and goals)|

Thus, the movement from Idea to Orientation to Condition to Structure is not an arbitrary schema, but reflects the recursive architectonic logic at the heart of Kant’s critical system—a logic by which reason continually generates, orients, conditions, and structures the forms of institutional life.

#### 2.3: The Ethics of Reconstructing Kant: An Enlightened Departure
The design template proposed in this paper is not offered as a neutral apparatus, but as a generative structure in which Ideas become operable within institutional formation. This transformation necessarily involves a reinterpretation of Kant’s critical system, particularly with regard to the function of Ideas. In Kant’s original framework, Ideas are not constitutive but regulative;[^19] they orient reason without determining empirical structure. To draw Ideas into the domain of institutional design may appear to exceed their philosophical jurisdiction. However, this paper does not propose to constitute institutions directly from Ideas. Rather, it understands Ideas—when mediated through the layer of orientation—as responsive: not blueprints to be implemented, but tensions to be sustained. Orientation, in this sense, is the movement by which an institution remains ethically attuned to the ideality that always exceeds it. It does not instantiate the Idea as structure, but configures the conditions under which the ethical force of the Idea can continue to resonate, not as presence, but as demand.
[^19]:CPR, A642–A669/B670–B697.

This reconceptualization is not a distortion of Kant’s regulative distinction, but a response to a contemporary crisis: not the overdetermination of institutions by Ideas, but their structural absence. Today’s institutions often lack any guiding horizon of intelligibility; they function without orientation, thereby precluding critique, resonance, or renewal. To reintroduce orientation is not to render Ideas determinative, but to safeguard the possibility of their intelligibility within form. In this sense, the orientation layer echoes the logic of purposiveness without purpose.[^20] Orientation, like aesthetic judgment, does not legislate an end but enables the reflective appraisal of form in relation to an indeterminate horizon. The design template inherits this aesthetic openness—not as a technical function, but as a way of embedding structural contingency and critical latency into institutional form. It is not a logic of closure but of structured exposure: a recursive architecture of potential reorientation.
[^20]:CJ, §9.

This reconstruction, then, remains faithful not to the letter of Kant’s architecture, but to the spirit of Enlightenment that animates it: the imperative to think without pre-given authority, to orient reason in public, and to emerge from self-imposed immaturity, as he famously defined Enlightenment: “Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-imposed immaturity. Immaturity is the inability to use one’s own understanding without the guidance of another.”[^21] The act of institutional design proposed here continues this gesture—not by applying reason as law, but by making institutional form capable of reflecting on the very Idea that exceeds it. In this sense, the designer—or the philosopher—is not a legislator of the Idea, but the first site of orientation: one who bears the ethical burden of remaining open to what cannot be finalized. Orientation thus becomes an existential posture before it becomes a design principle. Through this refigured relation, the template ceases to be a blueprint for ideology and instead becomes a fragile yet necessary structure for preserving the living relation between freedom and form.
[^21]:Kant (1991, p.54).

The proposed template is not an imposition upon Kant’s system, but a conceptual clarification of the architectonic strategy that Kant himself deployed to secure the durability and legitimacy of reason’s institutions. While any act of reconstruction carries the risk of overextension, this model aims to remain faithful to the critical spirit of Kant’s project—one that continually interrogates the conditions and limits of its own forms. By articulating these layers, the template does not fix a static order, but reactivates the recursive, self-critical dynamic that Kant saw as essential to Enlightenment. Any such reconstruction must remain open to further critique and correction; the aim is not to close the question of institutional formation, but to keep it productively open, in the Kantian spirit of critique.

### 3: The Philosophical Ground of Orientation
#### 3.1: Orientation as the Horizon of Directionality in Institutional Formation
The concept of orientation does not represent a projection onto Kant, but is deeply rooted in his own philosophical language. Kant defines orientation (*Orientierung*) as the act by which reason finds direction in the absence of objective guidance, invoking the notion of a guiding thread (Leitfaden) for rational navigation, as he writes, “We require a *guiding thread* (Leitfaden) when objective rules are absent.”[^22] This guiding thread does not itself legislate, but makes possible the orientation of reason in uncharted domains—including, by extension, the formation of institutional frameworks. Thus, orientation is not an afterthought, but a philosophical necessity rooted in Kant’s own concern for reason’s capacity to navigate the indeterminacy of Ideas and the contingency of form. Moreover, across his critical system, Kant repeatedly describes reason’s movement as one of self-positioning in relation to regulative Ideas—a process that is architectonic rather than accidental.[^23] Thus, orientation emerges as an indispensable, if under-theorized, layer mediating between the transcendence of Ideas and the immanence of institutional form. This paper therefore takes up orientation not as an external supplement, but as a central feature made explicit by a close reading of Kant’s architectonic ambitions.
[^22]:WA, p. 238.
[^23]:CPR, A642–A669/B670–B697; B860–B864.

In reconfiguring Kant’s three Critiques as a theory of institutional design, this paper introduces orientation as a central mediating layer. While Kant himself invoked the term orientation (*Orientierung*) to describe reason’s navigational role in thinking, he did not elaborate it as a systematic principle of institutional formation. The term diverges intentionally from adjacent notions such as stance, attunement, or disposition, which are often confined to subjective or affective registers. In contrast, orientation refers to a generative, pre-institutional modality—external to institutions, yet constitutive of their formation. The term diverges intentionally from adjacent notions such as *stance*, *attunement*, or *disposition*, which are often confined to subjective or affective registers. In contrast, orientation refers to a generative, pre-institutional modality—external to institutions, yet constitutive of their formation. It mediates the tension between the purity of Ideas and the actuality of institutional structure by establishing a directional condition under which institutions become designable and responsive.

In this sense, orientation resonates with but remains irreducible to inherited concepts within philosophical tradition. Stimmung, for example, configures the background affective attunement through which the world appears meaningful, but it does not directly engage institutional formation or responsiveness.[^24] Similarly, *exscription* and *différance* expose the constitutive indeterminacy and fragmentation of institutional meaning, but do not provide a recursive or constructive logic through which institutions might be redesigned.[^25] Even Henry Allison’s influential reading of Kant via standpoint theory—while clarifying the conditional asymmetry between theoretical and practical reason—remains primarily analytic and explanatory, lacking a generative account of orientation as design modality.[^26] In analytic philosophy, intentionality and commitment formation are frequently treated within frameworks of semantic normativity. Though helpful in understanding inferential structures of meaning, such concepts often remain confined to the linguistic realm and rarely extend to the plastic, world-mediated variability that orientation implies. Even in the work of Sellars and Brandom, who emphasize the institutional mediation of conceptual content, institutions themselves are not treated as pliable or redesignable formations.[^27] This paper thus advances a level of abstraction beyond these frameworks by proposing orientation as a generative stratum—a directional format that precedes and shapes institutional formation. Situated between Idea and institution, orientation functions as the format of directionality that renders institutions both formable and criticizable.
[^24]:See Heidegger (1962, §29, pp. 172–181) on *Stimmung* as a mode of ontological attunement rather than a principle of institutional mediation.
[^25]:See Nancy (1991, pp. 1-44) on *exscription* as the internalization of institutional outside; and Derrida (1982, pp. 1-28), especially the essay “Différance,” where institutional closure is revealed as aporetic.
[^26]:See Allison (2004, pp, 3-63), where the “standpoint” model provides a structural, rather than formative, reading of reason’s operations.
[^27]:See Sellars (1956, pp. 253–329) and Brandom (1994, pp. 13-25; 2000, Ch. 1) on inferentialism and the normative structure of discursive commitments.

The most crucial contribution of this perspective is the restoration of a horizon of responsiveness—that is, a background openness to critique and re-formation—in institutional presuppositions. Traditional theories of institutions have tended to privilege the analysis of internal modules—Ideas, conditions, structures, and implementation—while overlooking the pre-institutional layer that sets the direction of formation: the proto-formal thought modality that enables institutional genesis. However, when institutions become rigid or blindly functional, it is often due to the erosion or ossification of this very orientation. As such, *orientation* may be understood as a quasi-institutional horizon—a generative apparatus that, from outside the institution proper, nonetheless directs its internal development. It mediates between the Idea’s purity and the institution’s actuality, thereby rendering possible the variability and criticizability that institutions require.[^28] What gave Kantian philosophy its institutional robustness, I argue, is precisely its internal design of such “orientation-as-directedness.” Yet this paper does not treat orientation merely as a structural foundation for theory, but rather as a tool—a *template*—for the reconfiguration of institutions. By doing so, orientation becomes a generalizable and historically variable frame for institutional construction.[^29] The foregrounding of orientation as a generative layer in institutional formation is thus not an arbitrary conceptual innovation, but an explicit articulation of what is latent in Kant’s critical system—a move supported by close textual analysis as well as the demands of contemporary institutional critique.[^30]

#### 3.2: Reorientation: The Recursive Structure of Institutional Renewal
Orientation is not a one-time event. It recurs. The initial moment when an institution is directed toward an Idea is often framed as a singular founding act. But as this paper has argued, orientation is not merely a point of origin. Within the logic of the template, it functions recursively: reemerging when structural arrangements lose their responsive tension with the Idea, or when the mediating conditions cease to function effectively. Institutional change, then, is not simply external rupture—it can be understood as a reorientation, a renewal that arises from within. The concept of the template renders this process legible.

This perspective also reframes our experience of institutional impasse in the present. When an institution ceases to resonate with its founding orientation, when its conditions harden into mechanisms of repetition, we often perceive stasis or decline. Yet such moments may signal the threshold of reorientation—a latent responsiveness preparing to reawaken. The template is not only a design model, but a framework for recognizing when institutions become re-opened to their own questioning.[^31] In this light, institutional history becomes legible as a chain of reorientations. The transformation of universities from moral edification to critical inquiry, or of states from monarchical integration to civic deliberation, reflects not only sociopolitical shifts, but internal moments when a renewed orientation reconnected structure to a guiding Idea. This reframing is made possible by the template, which positions orientation as an ongoing horizon rather than a founding event.
[^31]:CPR, A642–A669/B670–B697.

Such recursion is not mere repetition. It is a spiral movement: institutions return to foundational tensions from new historical coordinates. The template’s key contribution lies in making this inner temporality visible. Rather than casting institutional change as contingent or linear, it locates transformation within the institution’s capacity to re-engage its guiding Idea. This line of thought resonates with Jonas’s ethics of responsibility, where responsiveness is framed as a temporal task grounded in foresight and return.[^32] Similarly, Luhmann emphasizes that institutions endure not through closure, but through their capacity to remain open to internal revision.[^33] The template crystallizes this reflexivity, positioning orientation as the inner vector of institutional change. To possess a template is not merely to possess a design—it is to possess a form for questioning. When institutional structures deviate from their orienting tensions, it is this capacity for reorientation that keeps institutions alive. Through the template, we can read institutional transformations in the past, sense thresholds of reorientation in the present, and imagine how institutions might be reformed—again, and differently—in the time to come.

#### 3.3: Preventing the Template’s Regression into a Violent Apparatus
Certain strands of poststructuralist thought have emphasized the inextricable entanglement of institutional form with mechanisms of power, casting suspicion upon any claim to shared foundations or constructive orientation. This critical stance has made an indispensable contribution by sharply illuminating the repressive potential latent within institutions. In this light, the institutional design template proposed in the present paper is not to be accepted uncritically. Depending on its implementation, the template inherently risks producing new forms of rigidity or empty formalism. In particular, when *orientation* is severed from its guiding Idea, or conditions are repeated without reflexive mediation, the template may cease to function as a space for re-opening freedom and resonance. Instead, it risks solidifying into a closed circuit—an apparatus that intensifies institutional self-enclosure rather than counteracting it.

Such concerns have been extensively thematized in twentieth-century philosophy, particularly in critiques by Arendt, Agamben, and Derrida. Their insights highlight the latent violence of institutional closure and the necessity of remaining open to rupture.[^34] Jean-Luc Nancy extends this concern into an ontological register, describing institutions not as closures but as spatial forms of partage—always exposed to their own exteriority.[^35] This directly aligns with the present paper’s understanding of the template as a movement of orientation—mediating between Idea and structure—whose generativity presupposes incongruity and contingency. Orientation, then, is not structure that continuously generates institutions by remaining open to moments of fracture—never disavowing, but incorporating the irreducible exposure and ethical tension at the heart of institutional existence. As Nancy writes, “What is exposed is not an individual self but the sharing of existence itself.”[^36]
[^34]:Arendt (1951) warns of institutions becoming systems “in which no one is accountable,” suppressing judgment in favor of bureaucratic order. Agamben (1995) cautions against the normalization of the “state of exception” that institutionalizes emergency as permanence. Derrida (1982) emphasizes that institutionalization always entails a violence of fixation through *différance*, revealing structural absence at every center.
[^35]:See Nancy (2000 pp. 26–29), where he develops the institution as a spatial form of *being-with*, constituted through *partage* and exposure, rather than through enclosure or completion.
[^36]:Nancy (2000, p. 28).

This proposal, however, does not neutralize the critical insights of poststructuralist thought. Rather, it seeks to inherit them otherwise: not as reasons to abandon form, but as reasons to redesign it from within its own ruptures. In this sense, orientation may be understood as a generative response to différance—not by resolving *différance*, but by inhabiting its displacement as the very condition of design. While *différance* suspends any stable ground, it does not preclude the emergence of form. On the contrary, it demands that form arise as a response to delay and aporia, bearing the imprint of its own instability. Likewise, *exscription* reveals not a rejection of institution, but the necessity for form to remain open to what traverses and exceeds it. Orientation, then, is not a closure but a modality of directed openness—an enabling fracture that preserves the capacity for renewal.[^37] From this perspective, the template is not merely a tool for future design, but a way of re-reading the institutional past—one that exposes how seemingly “natural” orientations have historically produced exclusion, domination, and closure. Institutions become violent not only through explicit coercion, but through unexamined orientations that silently sediment into structures. By making the circuits of orientation, condition, and structure visible, the template enables a diagnostic reading of institutional history—and offers a form for design that does not repress that history, but learns from it. In this sense, the template is not a neutral framework but an ethical apparatus: it renders past violence legible so that future repetitions become more difficult to enact.
[^37]:Derrida (1982); Nancy (1991).

Thus, the template should not be mistaken for a universal blueprint that resolves institutional impasses. It is a reflexive mode of directionality grounded in the finitude and contingency of institutions. Orientation is not closure, but a modality of exposure—an open structure of responsiveness that can incorporate rupture and resist ossification. When institutions are understood not as fixed systems but as unfolding circuits of questioning, the template becomes a generative form of critique—one that enables resonance not by finalizing form, but by continually reopening it.

### 4: Institutional Redesign as Philosophical Praxis
#### 4.1: The Open Possibility of Institutional Design
This paper does not call for the abandonment of institutions, but for their reconfiguration as open forms—forms that sustain both design and continual redesign. Institutions, as practices that present Ideas and values in sustainable forms of response, must not be conceived as static or fixed frameworks. Rather, they must remain provisional structures, transformable in accordance with historical and social contexts. As Jean-Luc Nancy has criticized the absence of a form of the common world,[^38] and as Hannah Arendt emphasized the visibility of such a world as the very condition for political responsibility, the construction of institutional form is indispensable for enabling both responsiveness and co-existence.[^39] Cornelius Castoriadis pushed this affirmation even further in his notion of the *imaginary institution*, reinterpreting institutions as the foundational stage upon which human beings enact their own self-creation and autonomy.[^40] Likewise, Mary Douglas highlights the role of institutions as enabling conditions for shared cognition and coordination, arguing that in the absence of institutional frameworks, even shared meaning becomes difficult to sustain.[^41] The view that institutions are structural preconditions for the common world is not a modern invention—it has roots in antiquity. Aristotle famously defined the human as a political animal (*zōon politikon*), capable of self-realization only through dialogical and collective activity within the polis. This ontological orientation toward institutional life, though ancient in origin, resonates deeply with Nancy’s conception of *being-in-common* and Castoriadis’s *imaginary institution*, together reminding us of the fundamental insight that it is only through institutions that we may participate in a shared world.

Now that both the latent violence within institutional form and the violence of absence in institutionless configurations have been laid bare, contemporary thought must respond to the question of how institutions might once again be reconstructed. This concern is shared by recent institutional and educational philosophies, notably in the works of Jacques Rancière and Gert Biesta. Rancière reconsiders educational relationships by positing the radical presupposition that “All men have equal intelligence.”[^42] This principle of equality does not merely dismantle the authoritative structure of institutional knowledge; it also discloses an alternative necessity—the necessity of structuring knowledge *within* the institution itself. Institutions are thus transformed from top-down mechanisms of knowledge transmission into shared spaces of continual responsive engagement. Rancière famously writes: “Equality of intelligence is a presupposition, an initial act of faith, not a program.”[^43] This hypothetical equality becomes the orientational stance from which institutional design can begin. Biesta, by contrast, warns against the overinflation of the concept of learning in contemporary education discourse, and rearticulates education as an evental interruption—as “the coming into the world of the new, the unexpected, the unpredictable.”[^44] For Biesta, education is not the transmission of pre-established knowledge, but rather the space wherein subjectivity emerges as an ethical event through institutional mediation. To ensure that institutional form does not stifle such eventfulness, an open orientation is required—one that resists the technocratic and managerial tendencies of modern institutions. Biesta situates this vision within what he calls an ontological turn in education: a rethinking of institutions not as technical frameworks but as responsive, co-present spaces of shared existence.[^45]

In this light, institutions must be understood as forms of response that, through the visibility of Ideas and orientations, sustain a common world and make possible the ongoing practices of responsibility and critique. And when those forms become mere forms—when institutions persist without Ideas or orientations—they risk transforming into self-justifying mechanisms that serve violence rather than community. Precisely because of this dual character, the task is not to abolish institutions, but to reconstruct them in ways sustained by Idea and orientation. What is required is not only institutional form, but also a *meta-institutional framework* that renders visible the principles upon which institutions are designed, and the conditions under which they remain open to critique. This structure is what this paper has proposed as the *institutional design template*.

#### 4.2: Diagnosing the Deformation of the Academic Institution through the Template: The Limits of an Epistemologically Enclosed Orientation
This section offers a diagnostic account of how the contemporary academic institution—introduced in Section 2.3—has increasingly exhibited signs of stagnation, in which the continuity of Ideas and the space for questioning appear constrained. This diagnosis is made through the institutional design template developed in this paper (Idea → Orientation → Conditions → Structure). Particular attention is paid to how institutional orientation tends to be dominated by an epistemological mode—often at the expense of alternative orientations. This has effectively excluded other possible orientations—ethical, ontological, and responsive—from the circuit of institutional design. Even in relation to Kant’s own system, such a reductive orientation reflects a partial and impoverished understanding of the conditions for institutional structure. Kant’s three Critiques did not simply delineate reason (in the *Critique of Pure Reason*) and practice (in the *Critique of Practical Reason*); they also introduced a third pillar—*the mediation between Idea and nature*—through aesthetic judgment and teleological reflection (in the *Critique of Judgment*).[^46] In institutional terms, this mediating capacity corresponds to an orientation that makes room for flexibility and generative openness between the freedom of Ideas and the constraints of structure.[^47] However, the modern academic institution tends to lean heavily on epistemological orientations grounded in reason and understanding, while remaining largely insensitive, at the level of design, to the freedom implied by aesthetic judgment and the imaginative reach of teleological reflection.[^48] This relative inattention to the mediating function of the *Critique of Judgment* may point to a structural blind spot—a one-sided rigidity in orientation that prevents institutions from integrating the freedom inherent in ideality.

[^47]:Guyer (2003, pp. 177-195); Ginsborg (2006).
[^48]:Zuckert (2007, pp. 110-136).


Such a blind spot is not adequately addressed by attending only to the vertical layers of Idea and structure; it becomes visible only when we posit an explicit intermediate layer of *orientation* between the two. The template functions as a mediating framework of intentionality—bridging the gap between Ideas and structures, allowing the symptoms of institutional fatigue and formalization to be translated into diagnosable configurations. In this sense, the template also serves as a philosophical device for rethinking not merely the structure of institutions, but the very mode of questioning that underlies them—that is, the design of orientation itself. Table 3 visualizes this imbalance in accordance with the template schema.

Table 3. Diagnosing Institutional Fatigue Through the Orientation Template[^49]
[^49]: Note: This table applies the four-layered philosophical template to expose misalignments in contemporary institutional practices. It is intended as a diagnostic heuristic, not a descriptive typology.

|   |Current Institutional Tendencies|Problems Diagnosed|
|---|---|---|
|Idea|Accumulation of objective knowledge; progress through reason|While the Idea formally exists, fundamental questions such as “What is knowledge?” and “Why do we pursue it?” have become institutionally invisible|
|Orientation|Monolithic epistemological stance (emphasis on analysis, control, and reproducibility)|Ethical responsiveness and ontological openness are excluded from institutional design|
|Conditions|Empiricism, reproducibility, performance metrics (e.g., impact factor)|Overconcentration on quantifiable outcomes results in a loss of diverse modes of inquiry|
|Structure|Academic journals, research funding, evaluation systems|The operation of the institution may inadvertently reinforce the rigidity of orientation, thereby limiting the conditions for free inquiry.|

#### 4.3: Reimagining Institutional Possibility: Designing for Epistemic Freedom and Resonant Futures
The institutional design template developed in this paper is not a finalized blueprint, but a generative schema for reimagining how knowledge, education, and technology might be transformed in contemporary society. Rather than reinforcing the rigidity of existing institutions, the template opens the possibility for plural, adaptive, and responsive modes of knowledge production—reconfiguring the very social architecture in which knowledge circulates. By applying the sequence of Idea, Orientation, Conditions, and Structure, I sketch below how institutions of knowledge can move beyond inherited constraints and become objects of deliberate and reflexive design, sustaining the freedom and joy of inquiry. For example, applying the template could mean designing academic environments in which:

- Peer review processes are replaced or complemented by collaborative, network-based evaluation, enabling more diverse forms of knowledge to gain legitimacy.[^50]
- AI is not treated as a replacement for academic labor, but as a co-orienting partner—helping to reveal, organize, and connect Ideas, without enforcing fixed standards of value.
- Educational institutions emphasize shared inquiry and epistemic risk-taking over standardized assessment, making the delight of knowing a shared institutional orientation.
- Blockchain-inspired ledgers or open-source platforms allow the circulation and preservation of knowledge outside traditional hierarchies.[^51]
[^50]:See also Fitzpatrick (2011); Tennant et al. (2017), whose work has been central in advancing new models of peer review and academic publishing. While their proposals achieve important procedural and structural reforms, the present template adopts a distinct foundational orientation, focusing less on workflow design and more on a philosophical rethinking of the conditions under which institutions remain open to questioning, meaning, and renewal.
[^51]:See also Allen et al. (2019), whose proposal represents an important advance in rethinking academic infrastructures through blockchain technologies aimed at openness and decentralization. While their approach focuses on structural and procedural innovations, the present framework is grounded in a distinct orientation—one that is not primarily technical, but ethical and epistemic, understood as a pre-institutional condition for institutional intelligibility and responsiveness.

The template is meant to invite further experimentation across a range of institutional contexts. Ultimately, the promise of this approach is not to offer ready-made solutions, but to make visible the conditions under which new forms of institutional freedom and responsibility can emerge—across academia, education, and technology alike. Table 4 presents preliminary illustrations of how each layer in the template might inform future academic institutional elements.

Table 4. Illustrative Proposals for Reimagined Academic Institutions[^52]
[^52]:Note: This table provides speculative examples of how each template layer might inform institutional innovation in academic contexts. These are not prescriptions, but generative prompts for further exploration.

|   |Proposed Academic Institutional Elements|
|---|---|
|**Idea**|A world in which the freedom and delight of knowing are affirmed|
|**Orientation**|Shared commitment to diverse forms of knowledge generated by human plurality|
|**Conditions**|Resonant AI[^53], blockchain technologies, ethically designed infrastructures for information-sharing|
|**Structure**|A meta-knowledge network in which resonant AI organizes and refines insights—regardless of institutional affiliation or peer-review—recorded and shared via a distributed epistemic ledger|
[^53]:*Resonant AI* refers here to a speculative and normative concept of artificial intelligence designed not to replace human intelligence, but to align with and amplify human orientation. While current AI development often prioritizes optimization, prediction, or automation, the notion of resonant AI envisions a co-creative partnership grounded in responsiveness, ethical attunement, and institutional adaptability.

In this envisioned configuration, the value of knowledge is not measured by institutional prestige or metric-based evaluation, but rather by its capacity to generate shared resonance and transformative potential for humanity at large. Knowledge, in this sense, is no longer a proprietary “achievement” of the isolated subject, but a co-constituted movement—emerging through relational attunement that implicates both knowers and the world as generative participants.[^54] Crucially, in this paradigm, technologies such as AI are not positioned as substitutes for institutional function, but rather as co-orienting agents—resonant partners that align with human Ideas and sustain adaptive institutional formation. This results in an open-ended, perpetually revisable institutional process, forming a non-hierarchical epistemic ecosystem in which all participants have access across the spectrum from Ideas to structures. Where biopower functions through epistemic regulation, the template seeks to reclaim knowledge as a space of shared uncertainty and institutional co-formation.
[^54]:See Merleau-Ponty (2012, pp. 56-65, 370-371), especially on perception as relational attunement grounded in embodied co-presence; see also Gadamer (2013, pp. 305-341), on *Wirkungsgeschichte*, where understanding emerges through dialogical and historically situated co-constitution.

While the institutional schema proposed here includes references to emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain, these are not intended as definitive technical solutions. Rather, they serve as philosophical extrapolations—tentative illustrations of how the institutional design template might engage with novel epistemic conditions. The aim is not to prescribe specific implementations, but to foreground the conceptual space in which reorientations become thinkable. What may appear speculative is, in fact, integral to the philosophical operation of the template: not to anticipate the future, but to render visible the conditions under which futures become designable. In this sense, Enlightenment becomes not only a personal or intellectual project, but an institutional one—requiring structures that remain open to critique, co-formation, and historical renewal.

### 5: Conclusion: Orientation as the Philosophical Praxis of Institutional Rebirth
The prevailing sense of impasse—of institutions without form—should not be taken as a terminal fate, but rather as a generative threshold from which the joy of redesigning institutions anew may begin. The concurrent emergence of artificial intelligence alongside this institutional closure is not a negation of human value; on the contrary, AI’s substitution of human faculties of understanding opens a space for a renewed encounter with sensibility and reason—indeed, for a re-discovery and deepening of the very essence of the human. The template proposed throughout this paper emerges precisely in the wake of this epistemic displacement: as a site wherein institutions may be redesigned at the level of orientation, a dimension irreducible to computation. How we might live more joyfully depends not on the structural stability of institutions but on the orientation with which we engage in their redesign. Since Kant, philosophy has been transformed from a project of rational autonomy into an endeavor that faces the wholeness of the human: as a being who questions, receives, constructs, and wavers. Twentieth-century philosophy, in various ways, responded to the limitations of rationalist paradigms by opening itself to the historicity and concreteness of human existence. While thinkers such as Rancière and Biesta have begun to frame institutions as ethical and evental spaces, the “Idea → Orientation → Condition → Structure” template proposed in this paper seeks to carry forward such philosophical developments while reactivating the latent design-theoretical potential already embedded in Kantian thought. That is to say, the very act of employing the template as a design frame is simultaneously a gesture of reconstructing the self as an orientation—an existential posture toward the world. The institutional design proposed here is thus not merely a technical proposal but an enactment of institutional generation as orientation. The concept of orientation introduced in this work not only mediates between Ideas and institutional structures but also functions as a practical-critical apparatus—sustaining the act of institutional design as a continuous philosophical engagement.

Institutions, in this sense, are mutable structures that can and must be designed through the articulation of Ideas and orientations. Philosophy, then, becomes the practice that makes this designability visible, reconnecting the force of Ideas to the institutional conditions through which they may responsively take form. The template functions as both a diagnostic and creative apparatus—capable of reactivating orientations beyond the exhaustion of institutional form or the hollowing of Ideas. Drawing from Kant’s self-critique of reason, Hegel’s dynamic development of the Idea, and Heidegger’s ontological trembling, the proposed framework seeks to enact the philosophical responsibility of preserving the human being as a subject capable of redesigning the institutional world. Such an effort is not immune to the violence of institutionalization. Because the template gives shape to institutions, it also risks reproducing forms of closure or repetition when the relation between Idea and orientation is itself rigidified. For this reason, the template must remain itself a perpetual object of philosophical critique. It is a double orientation: a structure that not only gives form to institutions, but also reflects upon the very form it imposes on the self. In this reflexive structure lies its capacity to resist violence. The most fundamental philosophical gesture offered in this work is not directed against institutions per se, but turned inward—toward the template itself, asking: *What does it mean to design? How may orientations be transformed?* It is this sustained questioning that defines the space of *exscription*—what Nancy calls the inscribed exteriority within the internal architecture of institutions. Moreover, to the extent that design is always marked by finitude, inconsistency, and delay, it also inscribes within itself a Derridean aporia: a structural impossibility of full response, which is nonetheless precisely the condition for ethical responsibility. The philosophy of orientation presented here proposes that the role of the philosopher is not to destroy institutions, but to orient them anew—through questioning and reconfiguration. In this spirit, philosophy becomes a frame-maker of institutional design: a form of fundamental knowledge capable of supporting future societies between joy and responsibility. Such a philosophy of orientation does not merely offer a critique of existing institutions, but provides a meta-institutional framework through which institutional legitimacy and transformation may be made visible and thinkable. Across domains—education, science, politics, and technology—the template may serve as a shared language through which the justification and modifiability of institutions can be linked, enabling new architectures of response to the crises of exhaustion, ethical void, and the disappearance of ideas that mark our time.

Furthermore, the concept of the template presented here does not only serve as a forward-looking design schema. It also enables a retrospective intelligibility: by making the mediating circuits between Ideas, orientations, conditions, and structures visible, it allows institutional history itself to be read as a series of orientational formations and disjunctions. In this way, the template offers a diagnostic grammar for uncovering how institutions have historically become sites of resonance or repression—depending on whether orientation was sustained, disrupted, or displaced. Yet real institutions rarely conform to a single orientation or Idea. Instead, they are often the contested space where multiple templates—each rooted in different Ideas and normative visions—interact, overlap, and interfere. This layered complexity is not a flaw but a feature: it reflects the irreducibly plural and negotiated nature of institutional life. The dynamics of such template multiplicity—how orientations conflict, hybridize, or silence one another—remain an open area for future theoretical development. A philosophy of orientation must, therefore, remain attentive not only to the clarity of design but also to the tensions of coexistence.

In summary, the expanded and deepened sense of orientation advanced in this work is neither merely an individual attitude nor a neutral procedural step, but the very philosophical praxis that mediates, sustains, and transforms the living relation between Ideas and institutions. Orientation, as argued here, is the creative-critical axis that makes institutional renewal possible—both an act of self-reconfiguration and an enabling condition for a shared, responsive world. Ultimately, orientation, as elaborated here, is inseparable from the very constitution of selfhood—it is not merely a principle of design, but the existential act of being-in-the-world. Through orientation, the human subject continually reconfigures both institution and self in the same gesture.
